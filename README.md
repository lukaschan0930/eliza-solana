# **AI-Powered Token & Swap Information Agent**

An intelligent AI-powered agent designed to provide real-time token and swap information in the Solana ecosystem. Built using the **Eliza Framework**, **Jupiter APIs**, **Discord Bot Integration**, and the **OpenAI API**, this project allows users to access seamless token swaps and real-time token data directly through Discord.

---

## **Overview**

This AI agent provides an interactive and automated way to access token and swap information via Discord. It uses the **Eliza Framework** for conversational AI capabilities, the **Jupiter API** for accessing the best token swap routes on the Solana blockchain, **Discord Bot Integration** for communication, and the **OpenAI API** to enhance the bot‚Äôs conversational abilities with natural language processing.

---

## **Core Features**

### 1. **Token and Swap Information**

- **Real-Time Token Data**: Fetch token details, market information, and trading pairs.
- **Token Swapping**: Enable users to find the best swap routes and execute token swaps on the Solana blockchain.
  
### 2. **Interactive Discord Bot**

- The bot listens to user queries, provides detailed token information, and answers swap-related questions directly in Discord.
- Integration with OpenAI enables the bot to process natural language queries and respond intelligently to user requests.

### 3. **AI-Powered Conversations**

- Powered by the **Eliza Framework**, the bot offers AI-powered conversational responses, ensuring a natural and engaging experience for users.

### 4. **Advanced Token Management**

- Get real-time prices, liquidity, and available routes for token swaps via **Jupiter APIs**.

### 5. **Natural Language Understanding**

- **OpenAI API** integration enables the bot to handle complex queries and provide intelligent answers with natural language understanding.

## **Getting Started**

Follow the steps below to set up and run this AI-powered agent.

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Immutal0/solana-ai-token-swap-agent-eliza.git
cd solana-ai-token-swap-agent-eliza
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

Install all the necessary dependencies using `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

### 3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the required API keys:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
JUPITER_API_KEY=your_jupiter_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 4. **Run the Bot**

To start the bot and begin interacting with it on Discord, run the following:

```bash
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

## **Architecture**

### 1. **Eliza Framework**  
The **Eliza Framework** provides a lightweight, conversational AI engine for handling natural language queries. It processes incoming messages and enables dynamic conversations with users.

### 2. **Jupiter APIs**  
Jupiter is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator for the Solana blockchain. It finds the best token swap routes across various liquidity pools, providing optimized transaction routes to users. The bot leverages the **Jupiter API** to query token prices and facilitate swaps.

### 3. **Discord Bot Integration**  
The bot interacts with users directly in Discord. By integrating with the Discord API, the bot listens to user messages, fetches token and swap information, and responds in real-time. It also supports commands for a more structured interaction.

### 4. **OpenAI API**  
The **OpenAI API** is used to enrich the conversational abilities of the bot. It helps the bot understand and respond to complex or ambiguous queries with natural, human-like responses.

---

## **Usage**

### 1. **Token Information Query**

Users can request information about any token, including its current price, liquidity, and best swap routes.  
Example command:  
`!token <token-symbol>`

### 2. **Token Swap**

The bot can recommend the best swap routes and execute token swaps.  
Example command:  
`!swap <from-token> <to-token> <amount>`

### 3. **General Queries**

Ask general questions about the Solana ecosystem, tokenomics, or ask the bot to help you swap tokens. The bot will intelligently answer using both the Eliza Framework and OpenAI's natural language understanding.

Example query:  
`How do I swap USDC to SOL?`
